## DURING DEMO

### Key Moments:
1. **0-2 min**: Explain the problem (manual email processing)
2. **2-4 min**: Configure email, show authentication
3. **4-6 min**: Show table with auto-extracted data
4. **6-9 min**: 🌟 **CLICK CANDIDATE** - Show split email/CV view (STAR FEATURE)
5. **9-10 min**: Answer questions, discuss next steps

### Make Them Say "Wow"
When you click on a candidate and the split-view modal appears - pause for a second. Let them absorb it. Then say:

"This is what makes our system unique. On the left, everything from the email. On the right, everything from the CV. You can instantly spot if someone's using a different email, or mentions different skills. No other system shows you this comparison."

## POST-DEMO

### If they love it:
"Great! I can have the full production system deployed within 10 days. Should I prepare a deployment plan?"

### If they have concerns:
"What specific features would you like to see added? We have the full enterprise architecture already designed."

### If they want to think about it:
"Absolutely. I'll send you the technical documentation today. Feel free to reach out with any questions."
